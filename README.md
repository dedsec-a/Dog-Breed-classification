Dog Breed Identification Using MobileNetV2
This repository contains a machine learning model built using the MobileNetV2 architecture to classify dog breeds from images. The model was trained to identify various dog breeds based on images using transfer learning.
Introduction
This project uses MobileNetV2, a lightweight deep learning architecture, to classify dog breeds based on image data. The model is well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained devices like mobile and embedded systems due to its efficiency and speed.

Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately predict the breed of a dog from its image.

Model Architecture
The model is based on MobileNetV2, a convolutional neural network architecture that is designed to work efficiently with mobile and low-power devices. The architecture has been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned to classify dog breeds.

Why MobileNetV2?
Lightweight: MobileNetV2 is computationally efficient, making it ideal for deployment on devices with limited resources.
Performance: Despite being lightweight, it achieves high accuracy on a wide range of tasks, making it suitable for image classification tasks like this one.
Key Layers:
Convolutional Base: Pre-trained MobileNetV2.
Fully Connected Layer: Custom layer for dog breed classification.
Output Layer: A softmax output layer for classifying into multiple dog breeds.
Dataset
The dataset used for training the model consists of labeled dog images, where each image corresponds to a specific dog breed. The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.

Input Size: Images resized to 224x224 pixels.
Number of Classes: Varies depending on the dataset used (e.g., 120 breeds from the Stanford Dog Dataset).
